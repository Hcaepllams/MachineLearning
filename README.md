这是http://www.ml-class.org/ 这个课程的作业，上传到这里纯粹因为方便我在不同的地方（上班和家里）完成作业并参考复习之前的作业。
根据Stanford Honor Code请不要直接照抄，而且我里面也埋了不少只有我知道的坑2333。

# Stanford Honor Code
"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
